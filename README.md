# Interactive Form

This project uses **JavaScript** to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

I will be adding JavaScript to **HTML** and **CSS** files to make the form user-friendly.

## Features:

- customized and conditional behavior & interactivity
- Validation for user input
- Helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

### Accessibility

- This website aims to be accessible to all users-
- Is in compliance with web regulations.
- Considers the needs of users with disabilities.
- Compatible with assistive technology recognition compatibility (e.g. screen readers, etc.)
- focus states of activities and form validation errors are highlighted in a way that makes it obvious for all users. 

# Please Note:
-  For credit card number validation, i am validating for Visa credit card that is 13-16 digits long. Visa cards start with the number 4. Please keep this in mind when testing the form. Use 4 as the first digit.
